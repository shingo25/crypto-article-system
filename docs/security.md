## Key Rotation Process

1. Generate new master key
2. Decrypt all secrets with old key
3. Re-encrypt with new key
4. Update key in secure storage
5. Verify all services can decrypt
6. Safely destroy old key

## Security Controls

### Authentication & Authorization

- Multi-Factor Authentication: TOTP-based 2FA
- Session Management: Redis-backed with expiry
- API Keys: Scoped permissions, rotation support
- Password Policy: Min 12 chars, complexity requirements

### Data Protection

- Encryption at Rest: AES-256 via Fernet
- Encryption in Transit: TLS 1.3 only
- PII Handling: Automated detection and masking
- Backup Encryption: GPG-encrypted archives

### Network Security

- Rate Limiting: Per-IP and per-user limits
- DDoS Protection: Cloudflare integration ready
- CORS Policy: Strict origin validation
- CSP Headers: Restrictive content policies

### Monitoring & Incident Response

- Security Events: Real-time alerting
- Anomaly Detection: ML-based behavior analysis
- Incident Playbooks: Documented procedures
- Forensic Logging: Immutable audit trail
